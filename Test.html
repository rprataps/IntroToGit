<H2>What is ACM/AITP? </H2>

<p> <font color="blue">The ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) is the world's oldest and largest scientific and <br>
educational computing society. Since 1947 it has served members now numbering over 80,000<br>
worldwide. The AITP (Association of Information Technology Professionals) is a professional association<br>
comprised of career minded individuals who seek to expand their potential. At North Carolina State<br>
University, the student chapters of these two organizations are combined (with two sets of officers)<br>
and serve students as a joint body, the NCSU Student ACM/AITP. </font></p>
